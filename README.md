The Shaper API
=====================

The primary goal of the Shaper API is to decentralize the storage of Netrunner card data.
The dispersal of this data across various servers will remove the need for tools and utilities to embed any copyrighted work and thus hopefully avoid a legal confrontation.
The servers hosting this data will be private and not easily discoverable.
The data that the servers are hosting is also freely available from the copyright owners and the storage of the data can be considered transient.

More coming soon...
